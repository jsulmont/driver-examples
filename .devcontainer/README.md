# XTDB Dev Container

A [Dev Container](https://containers.dev) that you can use to try [XTDB](https://xtdb.com).

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/xtdb/xtdb)

Once the Codespace loads, you can start running SQL queries against XTDB!

Use the VSCode 'SQL Tools' extension (connecting to the pre-installed XTDB connection).
